# C++ pool - 42 Angouleme

Here are the projects that I completed during de C++ pool of 42 Angouleme. This program allowed me to discover and master the C++ programming language through a series of practical projects called "Modules" that covers various fundamental concepts, including object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms, through hands-on coding challenges and collaborative work.

## Objectives of the Pool

- Develop a strong understanding of C++ syntax and semantics.
- Master object-oriented programming principles.
- Work with data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
- Implement algorithms for sorting, searching, and manipulating data.

## Structure

The C++ Pool is typically divided into several Modules, each focusing on different aspects of the language:

1. **Introduction to C++**
   - Basic syntax, variables, and data types.
   - Control structures and functions.

2. **Object-Oriented Programming**
   - Classes and objects.
   - Inheritance and polymorphism.
   - Encapsulation and abstraction.

3. **Data Structures**
   - Understanding and implementing various data structures.
   - Memory management and pointers.

4. **Algorithms**
   - Common algorithms for sorting and searching.
   - Time and space complexity analysis.

## Installation

To use the `Modules of c++`, simply clone the repository and compile it:
  ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/piscine-cpp-42.git
   cd piscine-cpp-42
   cd <Module>
  ```

## Usage

I implemented mains for each exercices so it's really simple:

   ```bash
    cd <ex>
    make
   ```
